Submitted by: Gokul Thangavel

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [x] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

w3schools hidden class: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_type_hidden.asp - Understanding the hidden class
w3schools css colors: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp - selection of colors for additional buttons.
w3schools image tag: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp - what images does
random number: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random - understanding what random does

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

Something that challenged my thinking was the functionality behind the code. This was my first time with Javascript, though I had worked with other languages before. I was quite nervous, yet excited to try something new out. 
For me, I believe that you should understand the meaning of what you code, no matter what you’re typing. 
I made a strong effort to understand the concept of what each function does in the pre-work rather than mindlessly copy and pasting. 
I spent the majority of my time breaking down line by line and reading up the functions to grasp the interconnectedness of HTML, CSS, and javascript. 
For example, when creating the random pattern generator. I got hung up on the logic of creating the random value that would fit the criteria and applying that value to the overall pattern. 
I decided to work on it by hand. Drawing out the input/output of what my random number function would do, what the input/outputs would be. 
Testing out the extraneous cases before coming up with the proper solution. Sitting down and understanding how each part of the code applies to my problem is something that I cherish greatly. 
I feel a great sense of accomplishment for sitting down at something that boggles my brain and working towards a productive solution. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

One thing after submitting this assignment was that I had independently done this assignment. Figuring out my own problems by myself, using the resources available to complete the project. 
In the real world, is that required by a web developer to have some independence on what they are working on? Or do they work in groups/teams? 
I am also curious about the kinds of impact that web development has on the world. Whether it’s for the societal or public good. Or if you just feel like doing it for fun.
One more question I have is what is the difference between a good web developer and a great developer? What skillsets make them excel? (Either hard or soft skills).

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I had a few hours to work on this entertaining introduction to web development. I’d most likely spend some of it adding the options for varying difficultly. 
I would like to code 4-5 levels of difficulty so that way it challenges the user if they feel like going for gold. 
Each level would have challenges such as seeing the whole pattern 1 time and trying to solve it. 
Another level can have buttons change color/ swap positions with other buttons. 
Personally, I’m an aficionado for challenges, anything that I can get my brain-fried with is something I would love to try to code. 
Another thing I would love to try out would be adding a high score list. 
I would like to code a list that contains the fastest time with the least amount of mistakes from the user. 
A visual like that would definitely motivate the user to beat their score.
